## 👥 **Target Audience**

| **Primary Users** | **Secondary Stakeholders** |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 🚜 Small to medium-scale farmers | 💼 Agricultural investors |
| 🌱 Commercial crop producers | 🏦 Agricultural lenders |
| 👨‍🌾 Farm managers and agronomists | 🛒 Produce buyers |
| 🤝 Agricultural cooperatives | 📊 Insurance providers |

## 🚨 **Problem Statement**

### Current Agricultural Challenges:
- **Fragmented Information**: Farmers struggle with scattered data sources for weather, soil, pests, and market conditions
- **Reactive Management**: Most decisions are made after problems occur, leading to significant crop losses
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Poor timing of irrigation, fertilization, and pest control wastes resources and reduces yields
- **Limited Expertise Access**: Small farmers lack affordable access to agricultural expertise and advisory services
- **Financial Uncertainty**: Unpredictable outcomes make it difficult to secure loans and insurance

### **Impact**: 
> 🔍 Studies show that poor decision timing can reduce crop yields by **20-40%** and increase input costs by **15-30%**.
